# Metronome App

# Overview

I built this app as my first ios app to learn the basic framework and I'm excited to learn more about building ios apps!

This is a basic metronome app that keeps a tempo for musicians. It allows the user to start and stop the puls and change the tempo he pulse plays at. The bpm is displayed on the screen for the user to see.

# Development Environment

To build this app I used Xcode and XcodeUI with the swift languate. I used a timer and the AVFoundations library to load the audio (or click) for the metronome.

# Future Work

* Allow sub-pulses to be selected/added
* Present the musical term for the temp speed (ex. Allegro)
* Clean up the apearance (cleaner start and stop button
